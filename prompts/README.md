The `(non)factual_<model_name>_(regular|constrained)_bs.jsonl` files are the texts generated with the prompt that is used for the evaluation by the factuality eval script. These files are generated in the semantic proxy decoding in the experiments folder under "factuality_prompt". The file with the same name and the `_results.jsonl` appended is the summary of the evaluation. The summary from the log is appended to the jsonl data in the attribute "raw".
